Develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

Overview

This repository contains a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data. The model enables intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems, allowing users to control devices or interact with computers using hand gestures.

Features

- Accurate hand gesture recognition from image or video data
- Real-time gesture classification
- Support for multiple hand gestures
- User-friendly interface for easy integration with devices or applications

Technical Details

- The model uses a deep learning architecture, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN), to recognize hand gestures.
- The model is trained on a dataset of images or videos of hand gestures, with each gesture labeled and categorized.
- The model can be integrated with various devices or applications, such as webcams, smartphones, or gaming consoles.
